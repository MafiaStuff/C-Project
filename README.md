# 📌 Item Tracking Program – Corner Grocer

## 📖 Project Summary  
This project is a **C++ program** designed to help **Corner Grocer** track item purchases.  
The program:  
- Reads a text file containing a list of purchased items  
- Counts the frequency of each item  
- Provides an **interactive menu** for users to query and visualize the data  
- Saves frequency data into a **backup file**, ensuring data integrity and future access  

---

## ✅ Strengths in the Project  
One of the strongest aspects of this project is the **modular design**, which enhances readability and maintainability.  

Key strengths:  
- The `getValidatedChoice()` function ensures **robust input validation**, preventing incorrect inputs.  
- The use of the **STL `map` container** efficiently manages item frequencies, reducing complexity in data handling.  

---

## 🔧 Areas for Improvement  
While the program is well-structured, some enhancements could be made:  
- Implement **exception handling** for file operations using `try-catch` blocks for graceful error handling.  
- Optimize file reading by using **`unordered_map`** instead of `map` for **faster lookup times**.

## 🚀 Challenges and Solutions  
One of the biggest challenges was implementing **robust input validation**.  

### **Solution:**  
✔️ Carefully handled `cin` errors and cleared input streams  
✔️ Used loops to **continuously prompt users** for valid input  

### **Resources Used for Debugging:**  
📌 **C++ documentation** for STL functions  
📌 **Stack Overflow** for community insights  
📌 **IDE debugging tools** to step through code execution

## 🔄 Transferable Skills  
The skills gained from this project—such as **file handling, input validation, and data structures**—are highly transferable.  

💡 These concepts are essential in **cybersecurity**, where:  
- Logging  
- Tracking  
- Secure data handling  
...play a **critical role**.  

Additionally, the emphasis on **modular programming and clear documentation** aligns with **industry best practices** for software development.

## 📂 Code Readability and Maintainability  
To ensure the program remains **readable and adaptable**, I followed these practices:  

🔹 **Consistent indentation & naming conventions** for clarity  
🔹 **Commenting** to describe function purposes and complex logic  
🔹 **Modular functions** to separate concerns and allow **future modifications**
